connect-4-scala
===============

A small competition between two people writing a connect 4 program in scala.
The competition was a motivating factor for learning Scala,
so don't expect the code quality to be that good.

The competition is now over and unfortunately Bruno Carle won 3-2

Both engines are very simple due to the limited time for the competition.
Except for an error in converting a board from one representation to
another (BitBoard.Engine.convert) the engines played without noticable errors :-)

If I get time for it I will improve my implementation (BitBoard.Engine)
in the coming weeks to include more comments, a transposition table,
alpha beta search with iterative deepening and better evaluation function.
